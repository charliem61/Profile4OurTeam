Goal/Motivation:

To create an application that uses Jest for running the unit tests and Inquirer for collecting input from the user. The application will be started by using the command - "node server.js". Tests can be run using, "npm test".


Problems Solved:

The application solves all criteria asked in this homework. A user is prompted to enter a name, id number, and email for each team member. Some team members have specific prompts that only apply to them. An engineer has an extra github prompt. An manager has an extra office number prompt. And a intern has an extra school prompt. After the user enters all data for each employee, and they choose none, an html doc is created that can then be viewed in a live server to display cards for each employee and therfore a Team has been generated. 
        
The Standouts:

The way each employee has their own card. The way the prompts are displayed and returned is smooth in my opinion compared to what I had in the begining and after much editing and time spent on rework.

Challenges Faced:

Perfecting each function so it completes the card for that Team member whether it be Manager, Engineer, or Intern. One would display but the next would go into error. With the help of my tutor we found the bug and ended up editing each function to solve the bug which in turn allowed us to have the first generated Html of the cards for each employee displayed with their own unique data.
